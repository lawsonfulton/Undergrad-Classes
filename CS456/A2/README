How to Run on Host 1:
    $./nEmulator <emulator sender port> <receiver’s network address> <receiver port> <emulator receiver port> <sender’s networkaddress> <senders port> <max delay> <discard probability> <verbose-mode>

How To Run on Host 2:
    $java receiver <network emulator address> <emulator receiver port>, <receiver port> <output file name>
