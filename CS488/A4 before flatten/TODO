***Notes***

-Not required to do reflection?
-A constant background is not acceptable.
-The easiest way to implement a hierarchical raytracer is to transform each ray from the Viewing
Coordinate System (VCS) to the Modeling Coordinate System (MCS) of each model. The trans-
formed ray is then intersected with models in a canonical position, so you can take advantage of
special forms of equations. 
-, you will probably find it easiest if you first
write a non-hierarchical raytracer (Objectives 1-6). Once you have that part of the code debugged,
add the hierarchical part (Objectives 8,9; affine transformations, a general hierarchy, and bounding
volumes for polyhedral objects).

***Warings***

Numerical problems abound. In particular, watch for the following:
- Try to minimise the number of times that you normalize vectors and normals. Each time
you normalize, you introduce a small amount of error that can cause major problems.

- The intersection of the ray and an object may actually be slightly inside the object.
When casting secondary rays (such as shadow rays), the rst object the secondary rays
will hit will be the same object. To avoid this problem, discard all intersections that
occur too close to the ray origin.

- Use \epsilon" checks in your intersection routines, particularly the ray-intersect-polygon
routine
In hierarchical ray tracing, on \the way down" you should transform the point and vector
forming the ray with the inverse transform.On \the way back up" you should transform
the intersection point by the transformation, and (assuming you represent the normal as a
column vector) you should transform the normal with the transpose of the inverse transform. Potentially, this transformation of the normal will result in a non-zero 4th coordinate, in which case you should set the 4th coordinate to 0 (or, write a special matrix-vector product that ignores the fourth coordinate, and uses the transpose). To speed things up you way want to precompute and cache all the VCS-MCS transformations. Expand the DAG into a strict hierarchy rst if you use caching.


***TODO***

You are required to implement the following ray tracing functionality:

- Hierarchical transformations and models. Use code from A3

- The sphere, cube, and (convex, planar) polygonal mesh geometry types.

- Bounding volumes (sphere or boxes) for polygonal mesh types.

- Point light sources, with a Phong lighting model.

- Output of the resulting image to a PNG file.

- One additional feature of your own choosing, and a scene file (and resulting image) that demonstrates this feature


Sample Command: You are required to implement an \additional" non-trivial feature. 


*** Things To Test ***
- Generate all rays at once, or one at a time?
- Precompute matrices in camera to speed up
- enable -O3
