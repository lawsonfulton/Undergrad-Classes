The final executable was compiled on this machine: gl08

How to invoke my program: 
Build
$ cd src/
$ make

Execute
$ ./rt <scene filename>

NOTE: Your current directory is the working directory for your lua script. So for example, if you are running hier.lua you must do:
$ cd data
$ ../rt ./hier.lua


How to use my extra features: 
- Supersampling and Multithreading: Controlled by compile time flags in options.hpp (On by default.)

Sample.lua render time on 2.2GHz Intel Core i7
****8 Threads + 4x4 AA****
Running time: 347.373 seconds

****1 Thread + 4x4 AA****
Running time: 1471.39 seconds

- Reflections and Refractions: gr.fancy_material({dr, dg, db}, {sr, sg, sb},
												 shininess, reflectivity, ior,refractivity)
The 3 new terms at the end are scalar values specifying the amount of reflection and refraction,
along with the index of refraction(ior) of the material.

I have created the following data files, which are in the data directory:
sample.lua, sample.png, sample-noAA.png
nonhier.png, nohier-bb.png, macho_cows.png, macho_cows-bb.png, simple_cows.png, simple_cows-bb.png, hier.png

My sample scene demonstrates all objectives and additional features: Cube, Sphere, Phong Shading, Shadows, Re
The scene is my A3 puppet staring into a glowing crystal ball(refraction) mounted on a stand made of a mesh cylinder and transformed cube. In the foreground is a reflective fractal sphere snowflake (reflections). Also it was rendered with 4x4 uniform supersampling (Anti aliasing) with 8 threads running(efficiency).

Since my sample scene was rendered at a high resolution, I recommend going to View->Normal Size in the image viewer to see the difference between sample.png (4x4 AA) and sample-noAA.png.

My program assumes the following:
N/A
